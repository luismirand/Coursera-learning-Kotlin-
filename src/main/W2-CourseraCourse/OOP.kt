// en kotlin t0do es un objeto

//INHERITANCE
//the creation of a new class by deriving from an existing one
//parent/super class and the derivatives are called child/sub classes

//POLYMORPHISM
//the ability of a function to change its behavior when called by different objects
//for example when combining two integers with "+" it adds both numbers but when used with Strings it performs a concatenation
//Polymorphism is a possibility to specify a type that accepts objects produced using different classes.

//ENCAPSULATION
//Limits access to a method and variables by encasing them in a single unit of scope
//prevents unwanted modifications reducing errors.

//ABSTRACTION
//hides implementation details for data security
